      </h3>
      <p style={{ fontWeight: "normal" }}>
        To Market and Promote the Subscription Service&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        We use the information you provide to HubSpot to market and promote the
        products, services, and other offerings. For example, we use the
        information, like your email or physical address, to send information or
        HubSpot content to you which we think may be of interest to you by post,
        email, or other means and send you marketing communications relating to
        our business. We use this information to promote the use of our services
        to you and share promotional and information content with you in
        accordance with your communication preferences.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also reach out to you via telephone to ask about other HubSpot
        products or services you may be interested in. If you have a call
        scheduled with a HubSpot representative, we may record and transcribe
        the call. You will be notified prior to the call that the call is being
        recorded, and you will be offered an opportunity to opt-out of having
        the call recorded.&nbsp;

      <p style={{ fontWeight: "normal" }}>
        To Communicate with You About the Services&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        We use the data you provide to HubSpot when signing up for the
        Subscription Service to contact you via email or in-app notification
        about billing, account management, and other administrative matters. We
        send updates to you regarding our Customer Terms of Service or other
        legal agreements. We may also communicate with you about security
        incidents via email or in-app notification.&nbsp;
      </p>

        We use your information to provide customer support, such as resolving
        technical issues you encounter and analyzing product outages or
        bugs.&nbsp;

      <p style={{ fontWeight: "normal" }}>
        To Provide and Improve the Subscription Service&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        We use your account information and Customer Data to provide the product
        and services to you. For example, we use the email address you provide
        when signing up for the product to create your user account, and we use
        your payment information to process payments for paid use of the
        Subscription Service.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect data about how our products and services are used by
        monitoring and tracking our product users. We use this data to develop
        and improve our products and services.&nbsp; For example, we use usage
        data to assess trends and usage across the product to help us determine
        what new features or integrations our users may be interested in. We may
        share usage data externally but will only do so in an anonymized and/or
        aggregated manner to build and improve product features.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>

      <span>fksgmk s &nbsp; dfds</span>

      <p>
        We use Customer Data in an anonymized manner for machine learning that
        supports certain product features and functionality with the
        Subscription Service. For example, machine learning helps power the
        business card scanner tool if you use our mobile apps and allows for
        easier imports of data into your HubSpot account. You may opt-out of
        having your Customer Data used for machine learning purposes by emailing

        sign-ups, and to detect and prevent product abuse. This includes

      <p>
        Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described
        above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific
        context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect
        Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where
        we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the
        processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your
        data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some
        cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal
        requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear
        at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your
        Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
        consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we
        collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate
        interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at
        the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
